### Introduction

I am booking travel to foreign cities for a bachelor party and I am interested in the number of adult friendly establishments that are available for entertainment options

The audience is single adult heterosexual males from 18-99

The problem is that it is not easy to gather information that would make for a great party in one place

The solution will provide a count of the number of adult-friendly establishments by city by category

### Data

Capstone will meed the geographic centers of major target cities to include "New York, Toronto, Montreal, Seattle, Bangkok, Tokyo, London, Singapore"

Capstone will use Foursquare data to poll for venue categories that include "Bar, Strip Club, Massage Parlor, Night Club, Beer Bar, Casino"
